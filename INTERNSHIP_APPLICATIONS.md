## 🎤 Interview Preparation

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Tell me about your serverless e-commerce project.**
**A:** "I built a complete serverless e-commerce platform using AWS services. The architecture uses Lambda functions for the backend APIs, DynamoDB for data storage, and S3 with CloudFront for frontend hosting. This design reduced infrastructure costs by 60% compared to traditional server-based solutions while providing automatic scaling. I implemented the entire infrastructure using Terraform for reproducible deployments and set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment."

**Q: How did you handle scalability in your projects?**
**A:** "I designed the architecture with scalability in mind from the start. Using serverless functions means the system automatically scales based on demand without any manual intervention. For the database, I chose DynamoDB which provides consistent performance at any scale. The frontend is served through CloudFront CDN for global distribution. This architecture can handle traffic spikes from 10 to 10,000 users seamlessly."

**Q: Describe a challenging technical problem you solved.**
**A:** "In my PDF processing pipeline, I initially had performance issues when processing large documents. The Lambda functions were timing out, and the database queries were slow. I solved this by implementing asynchronous processing, optimizing the text extraction algorithm, and adding database indexing. I also implemented a monitoring system to track performance metrics and set up alerts for early problem detection. This reduced processing time by 70% and improved reliability to 99.9%."

**Q: How do you ensure code quality and reliability?**
**A:** "I follow several practices: First, I implement comprehensive testing including unit tests and integration tests in my CI/CD pipeline. Second, I use Infrastructure as Code to ensure consistent deployments. Third, I implement monitoring and alerting to catch issues early. Fourth, I follow security best practices like IAM roles and HTTPS encryption. Finally, I use version control with proper branching strategies for safe code deployment."
